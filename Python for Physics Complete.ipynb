Looking in terms of the code block above, the <code>self.my_variable = input_variable</code> is telling the class that it has access to a variable <code>self.my_variable</code> and that this variable is set equal to our input of <code>input_variable</code>. The following line of code simply shows that the variable name inside the code with the <code>self.</code> tag can be exactly the same as the variable we use as an input, something that's actually standard practice.

Setters and getters are only for when we want a specific way to modify attributes; for instance, if we had made a bank account attribute, we would want users to get their balance but not set it, and if we had a secret list that only one person could see, we would want the majority of users only to set something into the list but not get the list. I couldn't think of a physics-based use of these, so that's the best you'll get as for motivation for now.<br><br>\n",

With the <code>_</code>, the variable is specified for internal use, hence not being able to change it without a setter method. There are also some attributes with two <code>__</code> underscores before their name, and honestly I have no clue what they're used for if they're not dunder methods (which we'll get to in the next section). As a little note, I believe attributes as I have defined them can be changed/gotten without setter/getter methods, that might come down to Python being less object-oriented than other languages or my lack of deep coding knowledge, but either way, it shouldn't affect your code.<br><br>\n",
    "To make attributes, like stated earlier, just put a <code>_</code> underscore before the actual name you mean to use. Then, to make a getter, we need to write a method with a line above it reading <code>@property</code>, and the code inside the getter method simply returning <code>self._variable</code>. As for setters, we again need a line above the method, this time reading <code>@class_variable.setter</code>, and the code inside the method (which takes a new variable as an input) being the standard variable setting of <code>self._variable = variable</code>. (Technically, the <code>@</code> lines above the definitions aren't needed, but that's something for the computer scientists to look over). To see this in use, let's look at the following example:"

The file doesn't need to exist in order to write to it, Python will handle that (theres also \"a\" for append instead of \"w\"). Once we have the file open, we can write to is using <code>f.write(text_here)</code> and close the file by <code>f.close()</code>. As an example, "
